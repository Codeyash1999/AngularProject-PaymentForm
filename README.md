I Have Developed An Angular Application That Handles Payment Information. The Application Uses Four Angular Pipes, Namely Currency, Decimal, Titlecase, & Date. Users An Input Their Name, Which The Application Will Convert Into Titlecase Format To Ensure Consistency In Presentation.
The Date Input Is Also Formatted And Converted Into A Suitable And Appropriate Format. Additionally, The Application Utilizes Currency And Decimal Pipes To Ensure That Numbers Are Presented In A Consistent And Easy-to-read Format.
My Angular Application Takes Into Account The User's Preferences For Date Formatting, Height, And Other Preferences, And Makes The Necessary Adjustments To Ensure That The Application Is User-friendly And Accessible. Overall, My Application Provides A Professional, Reliable, And Secure Platform For Handling Payment Information, Utilizing The Power Of Angular Pipes To Present Data In A Consistent And Easy-to-understand Format.
